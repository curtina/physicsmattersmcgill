Student volunteers may be eligible for McGill’s <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/involvement/ccr">co-curricular record program</a>.</p>

<p>To the question ‘Why should I take precious time off my research or classwork to do physics outreach?’, here are a couple of answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help inform the public about the importance of physics in the real world.</li>
  <li>Be a positive role model for kids and young adults interested in science</li>
  <li>Develop strong science communication skills.</li>
  <li>Broaden your network and opens doors to alternate career paths after graduation.</li>
  <li>Practice your French or English.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interested? Send an email to <a href="mailto:outreach@physics.mcgill.ca">outreach@physics.mcgill.ca</a> and we will add you to the Physics Matters volunteers email list where you will hear about planning meetings and volunteer opportunities.</p>
