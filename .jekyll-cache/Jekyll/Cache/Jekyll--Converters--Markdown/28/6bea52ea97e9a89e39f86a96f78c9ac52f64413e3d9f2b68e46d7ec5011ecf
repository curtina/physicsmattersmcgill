I"Ÿ<p><em>Abstract:</em>
The material world around us, from nectarines to nanotubes, from snowflakes to superconductors, is made up of atoms. But what are atoms, really? This knowledge is the culmination of a spectacular journey, from ancient natural philosophy to the prowess of modern science. Now, we are in an unprecedented position: For the first time in our history, we can manipulate atoms to build nano-scale technology, and exploit the unique and fascinating properties of the ultra-small. In fact, nanotechnology has already begun to shape our everyday lives. But how does this spectacular journey end? Are we doomed to a future dominated by â€˜nanorobotsâ€™?</p>
