I"é<p><em>Abstract:</em>
Neutron stars are formed when massive stars run out of fuel and undergo violent supernova explosions. With a mass comparable to the Sunâ€™s but the size of Montreal, neutron stars exhibit high densities, fast rotation and strong magnetic fields. Such extreme conditions cannot be recreated on Earth, making neutron stars excellent cosmic laboratories for physicists. In this talk I will take you on an exciting journey to the interior of neutron stars and show you how combining astronomy, astrophysics and quantum physics can teach us about the exotic behaviour of matter under extreme conditions. Come along if you want to learn about the densest stars, strongest magnets and largest superconductors in the Universe.</p>
