*Abstract:*
Quantum entanglement is a non-local correlation between objects that is only possible due to the strange principles of quantum mechanics. As strange as it is, entanglement is everywhere at the atomic scale. However, for a long time scientists haven't studied how entanglement is organized in a given system but have instead focused on its consequences. In recent years, the "entanglement revolution" has put the focus back on this fundamental concept. I'll discuss how this revolution is changing our understanding of matter, ranging from superconductors to ultra-cold gases, and I'll even touch upon string theory!
