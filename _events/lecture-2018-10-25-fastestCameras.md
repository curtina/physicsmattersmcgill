*Abstract:*
Many fundamental processes in nature occur on timescales less than one trillionth of a second and over length scales less than one trillionth of a meter.  Accessing these regimes of time and space experimentally requires the combination of state of the art laser science and electron microscopy to build extremely fast cameras.  With this technology, we can record images and make movies of processes in nature as they unfold in real-time. In this talk I will explain the technology which has led to the current state of the art, and I will also the present some information on the types of experiments which can be performed.
