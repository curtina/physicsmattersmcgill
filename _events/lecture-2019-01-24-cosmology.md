*Abstract:*
For over 400 years, astronomers have used telescopes to study the universe.  Technological advances have led to four centuries of remarkable astronomical discoveries. In the last few decades alone, we have discovered about thousands of new planets outside of those in our own Solar System, observed galaxies colliding and merging out to tremendous distances, and observed the entire universe to be expanding at an increasing rate, pulled apart by a cosmic force, unexplained by any of our current physical theories. Astronomers have ambitious plans for this new millennium, with giant new telescopes planned for both the ground and space. Dr. Freedman will focus on recent astronomical discoveries, and show how new facilities being built on Earth will address some of the biggest mysteries in astronomy today.
