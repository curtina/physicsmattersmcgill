*Abstract:*
Will Tesla succeed to transform the world, or fail in a series of fiery crashes?  What do electric vehicles and batteries have to do with the future of renewable energy?  Why does my cellphone battery get worse over time?  By understanding batteries at an atomic level we can understand what’s happening at our level.  In this talk we’ll explore how batteries work at an atomic level, the challenges scientists are trying to solve, and what all of this means for future technologies.
