*Abstract:*
Atomic nuclei are the tiny cores of atoms containing most of their mass and all their positive charge. If an atom was the size of a football stadium, its nucleus would be the size of a small marble at its center. Just like romantic relationships, opposite charges attract and same repel, so how can so many positive charges be packed in such a tiny core? Moreover, how can something so small be the source of the Sun's energy? Since the discovery of radioactivity 125 years ago, we have come a long way in our understanding of the nucleus and its constituent particles. In this talk, I will trace this exciting journey of nuclear physics -- an excellent example of how scientific ideas progress over time in light of new theoretical and experimental developments.
