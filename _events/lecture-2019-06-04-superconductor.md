*Abstract:*
First discovered in 1911, superconductors are fascinating materials with an absolutely null electrical resistance. Once an electrical current induced in a superconductor, it will continue flowing without degradation... for years! More surprisingly they are also able to expel magnetic fields and can even levitate above powerful magnets!
How is that possible? What are superconductors made of? And what amazing technologies can we build from them? 
In this lecture, we will learn how superconductivity works at the atomic scale before covering its various applications, from levitating trains to Dark Matter detectors.
