*Abstract:*
Today the universe is filled with stars, but the early universe had no stars. So, when did the very first stars form? To answer this question cosmologists travel to some of the most remote places on the planet. Using precise, portable instruments they study a faint radio glow that has the potential determine when stars first lit up the cosmos.
