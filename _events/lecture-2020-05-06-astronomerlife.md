*Abstract:*
Astronomers, and scientists in general, have travelled to the ends of the Earth to do their unique work and uncover the secrets of the Universe. In this special public livestream, McGill students Maclean Rouble and Josh Montgomery and Professor Cynthia Chiang talk about their unique experiences working at the South Pole and beyond. They discuss the special conditions found at these locations and how they can help with different kinds of astronomy. They also discuss what it’s like to live at the South Pole for an extended period of time - from how they spend their free time, to what kinds of food they get to eat!
