*Abstract:*
What is it like to be a theoretical physicist? In this live panel, McGill student Anh-Khoi Trinh and professors Eve Lee, Sarah Harrison, and Jim Cline discuss! Topics covered include from the underlying dimensionality of the Universe, the connections between the most fundamental particles and the overall structure of the Universe, and the formation of the stars and planets we see around us. These physicists also discuss their day-to-day life and their favourite recent sci-fi reads!
