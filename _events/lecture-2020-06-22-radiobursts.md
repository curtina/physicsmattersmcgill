*Abstract:*
In this virtual talk, McGill student Marcus Merryfield discusses the hunt for elusive, enigmatic fast radio bursts - rapid bursts of energy in radio waves from different corners of the Universe. Where do these bursts come from? What is making them? These questions and more are tackled during this talk. The field of fast radio burst astronomy is rapidly growing, and Marcus takes us along for a ride!
