*Abstract:*
Where do we draw the line between physics and other disciplines? Does such a line even exist? In this virtual talk, McGill Professor Paul François blurs these lines and explores the deep links between physics and biology. Topics include the connection between quantum physics and genetics, Einstein and Schrödinger, and much more. The modern questions of state transitions in cells, and how information is transmitted by biological structures, are also explored.
