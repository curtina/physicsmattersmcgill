*Abstract:*
Black holes come in all sorts of sizes - from those just a few times as heavy as our Sun to others millions or billions of times as heavy. McGill Professor Daryl Haggard takes us on a grand tour of the different black holes which lurk in the Universe. Prof. Haggard discusses the titanic supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 31 and the enormous feat of imaging this black hole, which was accomplished by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. She also talks about other, smaller black holes and how we can detect them using both gravitational waves and light.
