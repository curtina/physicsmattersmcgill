*Abstract:*
In this talk, McGill Professor Bradley Siwick takes us to the interface of physics, chemistry and biology. Prof. Siwick explores the question of whether it is possible to make a movie of a molecule undergoing some sort of chemical transformation with an atomic resolution. The answer to this question has important consequences for whether or not we can observe the proteins in our body doing their essential work, and much, much more. The challenges and techniques involved in making these movies are discussed.
