*Abstract:*
Invisible particles rain down all around us every day from some of the most energetic engines in the universe. Tracking down these engines has been a challenge for astronomers for over a century. Recent exciting work may be providing some key clues that can point to the origin of these cosmic rays. In this talk, Matthew Lundy will give a tour of some of these exotic locations from the largest stars in our solar system, to the collapsed cores of dead stars, and even to the supermassive black holes at the heart of many galaxies. Hopefully, we don’t end up magnetically deflected along the way!
