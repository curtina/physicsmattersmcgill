*Abstract:*
<br><br>
Think small.... really really really small. What does the world looks like and how do we study the natural phenomena that exist at these infinitely small scales? This is the realm of particle physics research.
<br><br>
Particle physics pushes our understanding of the natural world deep into the smallest fragments of spacetime, to unravel the physical laws that govern our Universe; but even with all the advances made to date, including the well celebrated discovery of the Higgs boson, we don't know it all!
<br><br>
In this presentation, we will explore an example of research work that is currently being done using the unique infrastructure that is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory. I will then describe ongoing work that will lead to new research opportunities in the coming years, and will close with a long-term look at the possible future particle collider facilities under discussion within the global particle physics community.
