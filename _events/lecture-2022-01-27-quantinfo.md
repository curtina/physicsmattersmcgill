We are back and very excited to announce our first event of the Winter! On January 27th, we will be hosting a panel event with three McGill Professors who study the cutting-edge field of quantum information! Ever wondered what a qubit is, or how quantum effects can be harnessed in the real world? Come and hear about the exciting work that professors Bill Coish, Lilian Childress, and Kartiek Agarwal do related to interpreting and handling quantum information! You have questions? They have answers! This will be an interactive event where you will be able to ask questions and have the panelists discuss them at length.
