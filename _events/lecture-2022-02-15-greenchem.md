Much research has been done on the uses and creation of futuristic molecules such as nanoparticles and biopolymers, but at what cost to the environment? Prof. Moores works in the area of green chemistry to find ways to access these materials more sustainably.
She works at the interfaces between the fields of nanoparticle science, material chemistry, and organic synthesis. She will talk about two related projects where theyâ€™ve been using solid phase synthesis, mechanical activation, and aging to access nanoparticles and biopolymers. These projects are highly collaborative, and her group works with folks in physics, chemistry, the National Research Council Canada and Mechanical Engineering. And there will be plenty of crabs as well.
