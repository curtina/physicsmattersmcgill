<p><em>Abstract:</em>
Cosmology is a natural meeting ground between fundamental theory (e.g. superstring theory or quantum gravity) and observations. This lecture
explores how seeds laid down in the very early universe developed into the large-scale structure we observe today, and how this may teach us about the beginnings of the universe.</p>
