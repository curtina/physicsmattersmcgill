<p><em>Abstract:</em>
When we talk about human history, we focus on great leaders, revolutions, and technological advances. But how has the Earth itself determined our destiny? How has our planet made us?</p>

<p>As a species we are shaped by our environment. Geological forces drove our evolution in East Africa; mountainous terrain led to the development of democracy in Greece; and today voting behaviour in the United States follows the bed of an ancient sea. The human story is the story of these forces, from plate tectonics and climate change, to atmospheric circulation and ocean currents.</p>

<p>By taking us through millennia of human history, and billions of years into our planetâ€™s past, Professor Lewis Dartnell tells us the ultimate origin story.</p>
