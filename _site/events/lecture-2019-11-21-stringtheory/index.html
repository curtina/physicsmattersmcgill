<p><em>Abstract:</em>
What makes up the world around us? Cells, molecules, atoms, electrons. What is the smallest possible building block of Nature? In this talk, I present to you the leading theory conjectured to explain everything from the origin of matter itself, to the genesis of our cosmological Universe: string theory. Join us and learn of the culmination of 50 years of string theory research which includes a discussion on black holes, quantum computers, wormholes, and much more!</p>
