<p align="center">

</p>

Have you ever wondered why some objects sink and others float? As part of [McGill’s Bicentennial](https://200.mcgill.ca/) and [24 Hours of Science](https://www.science24heures.com/en/), come find out with PhysicsMatters' **Sink or Float** activity! Kids of age ~9-11 are all welcome to this highly interactive, **online** learning session where we will discover what makes an object sink or float by performing hands-on experiments with common household objects.


The event will take place on Zoom. To register your child for this activity, please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/Bihehs50HC).


This session will be performed in English. Pour la version française, suivez [ce lien](https://forms.office.com/r/SxeahykVZW).

Have you ever taken a close look at the Moon and wondered how it got to be so bumpy, instead of being smooth? Come find out with AstroMcGill + PhysicsMatters' **Craters** activity! Kids of age ~9-11 are all welcome to this highly interactive, **online** learning session where we will make our own craters and find out why they come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. All experiments use only common household objects. A document containing a list of objects will be added shortly.
