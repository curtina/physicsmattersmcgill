Do you ever wonder how cutting edge research is being carried out?  Or what the daily life of a physicist is like? Or maybe you just find science really cool and fascinating. If so, the Girl in Physics Day is meant for you!
 
This special outreach day is aimed at high school girls who would like to visit the McGill Physics Department, meet students and researcher, and learn more about physics. The program of the day includes several lab visits, a hands-on experiment with superconductors, and lectures and presentation. Several fields of physics will be covered including particle physics, condensed matter, and astrophysics. The event is held once a year and students should register to attend, the number of spots is limited.

# About the event:
The Girls in physics day is meant to make high school girls discover the world of research in physics. It is organized by McGill Physics Outreach Committee with the support of the Women in Physics Committee. Even today, girls are not being exposed to science as much as boys resulting in an important under-representation of women in the field. We are hoping that this outreach event might sparkle some interest in physics and science more broadly among the visiting students.
