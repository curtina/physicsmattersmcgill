Dear particle physics enthusiasts,

We would like to invite you to this year's Particle Physics Masterclass organized by the McGill ATLAS research group on Thursday, 22nd March, 2018 from 9:30-16:30.

It is a full day event for CEGEP and high school students (and their teachers too!) to learn about particle physics and detectors. The event includes exciting lectures about high energy physics, a tour of the McGill labs facility, a virtual visit of the CERN Control Room and hands-on data analysis. In addition, participating students will receive a Certificate of Participation on successfully completing the Masterclass. The event is in English, but many members of our group are French native speakers, so students can freely talk to them in French if desired.

For more information you can visit the masterclass website: [http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/masterclass/](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/masterclass/)

The event is totally free and lunch will be provided (please specify eventual dietary restrictions upon registration). For registration (or any other question) please contact: [atlas-masterclass@physics.mcgill.ca](mailto:atlas-masterclass@physics.mcgill.ca).

You are encouraged to register as soon as possible as there are limited spots!

We are looking forward to see you at the ATLAS Masterclass, 2018.

Shreya Saha and Auriane Canesse,<br/>
McGill masterclass coordinators
