## Open House
Interested in pursuing an undergraduate physics degree? Wondering what kind of research happens in the physics department at McGill? Each year we host an open house for students interested in seeing what our department is all about. This year, the event will be occurring on Sunday, October 21, 2018 (more details coming in September). Visit the [event page](https://www.mcgill.ca/openhouse/open-house) for more details.

## ATLAS Masterclass
Wondering what's particle physics? Heard about the Higgs boson and would like to know more? Think you are already an expert in particle physics and want to test off your skills by analyzing real data? If you said yes to any of these questions, then you ought to come to the free particle physics [Masterclass](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/masterclass/) organized by the [ATLAS experiment](http://www.atlas.ch/) research group at McGill University!

## Physics Hackathon
The [McGill Physics hackathon](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon2018/), started in 2016, is a hackathon devoted to solving and visualizing physics problems. Participant teams will be challenged to use scientific computing tools and/or microelectronic gadgets to demonstrate a concept, phenomenon or application involving the physical sciences.

## McGill Physics Olympiad Program
Are you a high school or CEGEP student interested in competitive physics olympiads? Our [McGill Physics Olympiad Program](/mpop) (MPOP) offers mentorship and practice sessions led by undergraduate physics students experienced in these competitions.

## Physics Matters Summer Internships
The Physics Matters outreach group has [summer internships](/interns) available for Montreal area CEGEP or undergraduate students.

## Girls in Physics Day
The Girls in Physics Day is a yearly event started in 2018 aimed at high school girls from secondary 3-5. During this all-day event, students will visit the department's labs, attend presentations, carry out hands-on experiments, and meet with physics students and professors.
Visit the [event page](/girls) for more information.
