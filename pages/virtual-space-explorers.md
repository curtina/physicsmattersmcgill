In response to the pandemic, we have adapted our **Sink or Float** module from the Space Explorers program to a new format which can be done **completely remotely** via either Microsoft Teams or Zoom! Teachers do not need to have a MS Teams/Zoom license to be able participate, and all materials are common household/classroom items like erasers, rocks, and aluminum foil. We can help supply any missing materials.

Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:outreach@physics.mcgill.ca">outreach@physics.mcgill.ca</a> if you would like to arrange a remote lesson for your class, and check back here later - new modules are in development!
